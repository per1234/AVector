#AVector

Vector class for **`Arduino`** based on **`Processing`**'s [PVector class](https://github.com/processing/processing/blob/44248a80d111b1710a4781739327afa18d3593fa/core/src/processing/core/PVector.java) by Dan Shiffman, Ben Fry and Casey Reas.
My inspiration for writing this is Dan Shiffman's awesome book [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com), which he has graciously [posted on his website](http://natureofcode.com/book/) in its entirety. It's definitely worth buying a [print edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0985930802/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0985930802&linkCode=as2&tag=natureofcode-20) though. You wont regret it!



## Getting started

### `AVector` class

A class that describes a 2D vector. This can be used to describe a vector like velocity or acceleration, or used to describe a position. 

This class also includes common vector operations (addition/subtraction, rotation, dot product etc).
