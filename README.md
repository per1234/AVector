#AVector

Vector class for **`Arduino`** based on **`Processing`**'s PVector class by Dan Shiffman, Ben Fry and Casey Reas.
My inspiration for writing this is Dan Shiffman's awesome book [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com), which he has graciously [posted on his website](http://natureofcode.com/book/) in its entirety. It's definitely worth buying a [print edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0985930802/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0985930802&linkCode=as2&tag=natureofcode-20) though. You wont regret it!
